Use of COVIDSafe is completely voluntary. You can install or delete the application at any time. If you delete COVIDsafe, *you may also ask for your information* to be deleted from the secure server.

To register for COVIDSafe, you will need to enter a name, mobile number, age range and postcode.

COVIDSafe will not collect your location information.\n\nCOVIDSafe will note the time of contact and an anonymous ID code of other COVIDSafe users you come into contact with.

Other COVIDSafe users you come into contact with will note an anonymous ID code and the time of contact with you on their device.

If another user tests positive to COVID-19, they may upload their contact information and a state or territory health official may contact you for contact tracing purposes.

Your registration details will only be used or disclosed for contact tracing and for the proper and lawful functioning of COVIDSafe.

More information is available at the *Australian Government Department of Health website*.
